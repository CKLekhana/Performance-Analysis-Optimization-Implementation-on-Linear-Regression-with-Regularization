# Performance Analysis of Regularization Techniques in Linear Regression

This project was taken up to understand linear regression and regularization techniques for both mathematical and computational understanding. \
I got to understand how loss functions are used as an basis to build models that make accurate predictions. Also understood how regularization and optimization affect model learning and performance. \

I also understood how to perform structured research that is mathematically and empirircally. I now have a better understanding on how to perform preliminary data analysis and choose models appropriately. \
I am looking forward to taking more projects like these to understand Machine Learning and AI in general, in a deeper way rather than superficially.
